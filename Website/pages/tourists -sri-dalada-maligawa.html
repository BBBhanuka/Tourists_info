<p>Temple of the Tooth Relic -The Dalada Maligawa
    The importance of the temple of the tooth relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka is based on the fact that it safe keeps a tooth of the Buddha ,
     which is highly venerated by the Buddhists world over as it had experienced all of Buddha’s verbal energy vibrations created while expounding the Dhamma of Noble Truth to his followers during the whole lifetime after becoming enlightened. <br>
     Majority of Sinhala people who are Buddhists in the country call this tooth relic temple as Sri Dalada Maligawa. Though the Buddha was born in northern India, now Nepal, his doctrine or the school of thought did not live long in India. <br>
     Instead it was in Sri Lanka that his Dhamma took the foothold for centuries onward up to the present day. Buddhists pay homage and venerate the Buddha relics on par with treating the living Buddha. Both Indian and Sri Lankan history indicates the reign by monarchs in those countries. <br>
     Since the time that the highly preserved Buddha tooth relic was brought to Sri Lanka from Kalinga (an Indian state) the ruling king safe kept the Tooth relic in a special building adjacent to the royal palace. It was the practice throughout the long history until the end of the reign of last king Sri Vikrama Rajasingha in 1815.</p>
<p>Relics of the Lord Buddha is venerated by all Buddhists throughout the world and the relic at the Dalada Maligawa is the left Canine Tooth of the Lord Buddha which is one of the remains of the cremated body of the Lord Buddha after the Parinirvana. It is said to be removed by the Arahanth Kema, who is a pupil of the great Arahanth Sariputta and given to King Brahmadatta of Kalinga, India.<br>
     For centuries it was venerated and homage was paid by the Buddhists of Kalinga. <br>During the time of King Sirimeghavanna (301 - 328 AD ) of Anuradhapura, the Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka by Prince Dantha (son of the King of Udeni ) and Princess Hemamali ( daughter of King Guhasiva ).<br> During a war waged to obtain the possession of the Relic tooth by the nephews of King Pandu against King Guhasiva, this was brought to Sri Lanka by Hemamali and Danta in the guise of Brahmins and the Tooth Relic was hidden and concealed in Princess Hemamali's hair. <br>
     The Lord Buddha Tooth relic which is presently at the Dalada Maligawa was brought to Kandy during the rein of king Vimaladharmasuriy I and he made a two storied Palace to place the Tooth Relic.<br> During the first few centuries , it had been placed at Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Beligala Rock, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala and Kotte kingdoms.<br> Due to Portuguese invasion it was taken away by Buddhist priests to a mountanous region of Kandy and once Kandy was under the rule of the king, it was brought back again. Later King Vimaladharmasuriy II ( 1687-1707 AD) had built a three storied Tooth Relic Palace. <br>
     King Parakrama Narendrasinghe ( 1707-1739 AD ) has also build a two storied temple for the Tooth Relic.<br> 
    The Last King of Sri Lanka, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe made the Octagonal Building called “ Pattirippuwa” and the moat in front of the Palace.</p>
