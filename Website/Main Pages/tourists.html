            Sri Lanka, being an island, is known for her amazing beaches and views of the sea.

        </p>
        <p>
            Galle Face Green (Galle Face Beach) is a half kilometer promenade in the heart of Colombo and was initially laid out in 1859 by Sir Henry Ward, Governor of British Ceylon. The stretch of land was used for horse racing and golf and was known as the Colpetty Race Course.

    <h1>Buddhist Ruins in Polonnaruwa - Polonnaruwa Vatadage</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <p>The Vatadage, located at Polonnaruwa Ancient City, is yet another work of wonderful art that gets an exalted position in the annals of local history. It is this par excellence in vatadage design. In fact it gives the modern audience an incredible view of what a complete vatadage would actually have looked like. However it is lacking a roof, which would have been a large dome, judging by the curvature of the walls at least. There is some doubt concerning the sponsor of this building. It might even have been a flattened roof with curved edges, but one can reconstruct this structure any way they please, given that it is within the realms of historical feasibility. Tiles have been found in the vicinity of this building. </p>
